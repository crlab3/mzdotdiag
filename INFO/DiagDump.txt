3 = - = not used

MECS-II (CEL) Check Engine Light codes
These are the main check engine light codes for MECS-II 626's. You put the car into diagnostic mode by using a jumper wire between the C (TEN) &amp; E (GROUND) pins of the diagnostic box under the hood of your car.

Code = Memory = Circuit Diagnosed
02 = Yes = 'NE2' crankshaft position sensor
03 = Yes = 'G' camshaft position sensor
04 = Yes = 'NE1' camshaft/crankshaft position sensor
05 = Yes = Knock sensor
08 = Yes = Volume Air Flow sensor (VAF)
09 = Yes = Coolant temperature sensor (CTS)
10 = Yes = Intake air temperature sensor (IAT)
12 = Yes = Throttle position sensor (TPS)
14 = Yes = Barometric pressure sensor
15 = Yes = LHO2S inactivation error
16 = Yes = Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system
17 = Yes = LHO2S inversion error
23 = Yes = RHO2S inactivation error
24 = Yes = RHO2S inversion error
25 = Yes = Fuel pressure regulator control solenoid
26 = No = Canister purge solenoid
28 = No = EGR vacuum solenoid
29 = No = EGR vent solenoid
34 = No = Idle air control (IAC) solenoid
41 = No = VRIS #1 solenoid
46 = No = VRIS #2 solenoid
67 = No = LFAN relay (1993 only)
69 = Yes = ECTF sensor (1993 only)

(HOLD) Automatic Transmission (ATX) Malfunction codes
Automatic transmission codes can be read by connecting the TAT and GND pins (see above for the location of this pin) and watching the "hold" light on the instrument cluster. The codes are read exactly as they are when reading the engine codes, except that the Hold light flashes, not the Check Engine Light. A summary of the codes and the reasons:

01 = NE1 (crankshaft position sensor)
06 = Vehicle speed sensor
12 = Throttle position sensor
14 = BARO sensor (located within PCME)
55 = Vehicle speed pulse generator
56 = ATF thermosensor
57 = Reduce torque signal 1
58 = Reduce torque signal 2
59 = Torque reduced/ECT sensor
60 = 1-2 shift solenoid valve
61 = 2-3 shift solenoid valve
62 = 3-4 shift solenoid valve
63 = converter lock-up solenoid valve
64 = 3-2 timing solenoid valve
65 = converter lock-up valve
66 = line pressure solenoid valve

(ABS) Anti-Lock Braking System Malfunction codes
Anti-lock braking (ABS) system codes are read when the TBS and GND pins are connected in the Diagnostic connector (see above). The codes are read, again, like the engine codes, but now on the ABS light on the instrument cluster. A summary of codes and the reasons:

11 = Right front wheel speed sensor or rotor
12 = Left front wheel speed sensor or rotor
13 = Right rear wheel speed sensor or rotor
14 = Left rear wheel speed sensor or rotor
15 = Wheel speed sensor
22 = Hydraulic unit harness
51 = Fail-safe relay
53 = Motor or motor relay
61 = ABS control unit

(SRS) Supplemental Restraint System Malfunction codes
The supplemental restraint (SRS), more commonly known as the "air bag" system will flash the highest priority code on the air-bag lamp on the dash with no need for any pin in the Diagnostic box to be grounded. The codes are read, again, like the engine codes, but now on the Air Bag light on the instrument cluster. A summary of codes and the reasons (NOTE: these are from a 1993 Ford Service Manual. Later models with dual airbags (1994+) may have additional codes not covered here. Email me if you encounter one. Also, I hope but am unsure if these apply to the MX-6...):

In order of priority from highest to lowest:
- = No air bag lamp: diagnostic monitor (DM), ignition power or bulb circuit
- = Continuous lamp: DM disconnected or inoperative
12 = Low battery voltage
13 = Air bag circuit or crash sensor shorted to ground
21 = Safing sensor mounted incorrectly
22 = Safing sensor: output shorted to battery voltage
23 = Safing sensor input feed or return circuit open
24 = Open in circuit 944B or low-resistance in crash sensor(s)
32 = Driver's side air-bag / safing sensor: high resistance or open
33 = Pin 7 not grounded at DM
34 = Driver's side air-bag / safing sensor: low resistance or shorted
35 = Low resistance across pins 8 and 9 of DM
41 = Crash sensor circuit: high resistance or open
44 = RH crash sensor not mounted properly
45 = Center (radiator) crash sensor not mounted properly
46 = LH crash sensor not mounted properly
51 = DM internal fuse: blown and short to ground no longer exists
52 = Backup-power supply: voltage boost fault
53 = Internal DM fault
- = Rapid continuous flashing or air-bag lamp: all crash sensors disconnected
